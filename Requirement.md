# **Project: Personalized Learning Platform with DevCycle and Gamification**

## **Challenge-Specific Goals:**

1. **Leverage Feature Flags**:
   - Use DevCycle to toggle features dynamically:
     - Gamification mechanics (points, badges).
     - Adaptive difficulty for quizzes.
     - RSS feed personalization options.
2. **Creative Use Case**:
   - Highlight the combination of RSS feed curation and gamified learning as an innovative solution.
3. **Showcase with a Clear Submission**:
   - Provide a write-up with links to the repository and a live demo (using Vercel for deployment).
   - Clearly explain how DevCycle enhances flexibility and experimentation.

### **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React framework with SSR/CSR capabilities).
- **Backend**: Express.js (REST API for managing user data and RSS feeds).
- **Feature Flags**: DevCycle SDK for server-side and client-side toggles.
- **Database**: MongoDB (storing user preferences, progress, articles).
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Next.js) and Render/Heroku (Express API).

### **Core Features Using Feature Flags**

1. **RSS Feed Toggles**:
   - Feature flags to enable specific feed categories or experimental personalization algorithms.
2. **Gamification Toggles**:
   - Enable/disable badges, weekly challenges, or dynamic point boosts.
3. **Progressive Feature Rollouts**:
   - Test UI/UX changes or new lesson formats with subsets of users.
4. **Dynamic Gamified Quizzes**:
   - Toggle between simple quizzes and advanced adaptive quizzes.

### **Architecture Overview**

#### **1. Frontend (Next.js)**

- Fetch user-specific RSS feeds and gamified content.
- Use DevCycle's client-side SDK for toggling UI features dynamically.

#### **2. Backend (Express)**

- Parse RSS feeds and serve filtered content.
- Manage user preferences, progress, and gamification data.
- Use DevCycle's server-side SDK to toggle backend logic (e.g., advanced filtering algorithms).
